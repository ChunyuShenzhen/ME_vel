# ME_vel
3D Mississippi embayment Rayleigh and Love group velocity and shear wave velocity 

In shear wave velocity files, for example in shear_wave_velocity/5.out


in each line, 
longitute, latitute, Vsv, Vsh, vs, anisotropy.

Vsv is inversion from Rayleigh wave dispersion curves only.
Vsh is inversion from Love wave dispersions.
Vs is joint inversion from Rayleigh and Love wave dispersions.
